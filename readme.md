The client facing portion of Skookumchuck Botanical's tooling.


### Inventory Manager
Prices, purchases, and inventory of products will be tracked here.
A "database" (text file) will be able to be generated to print labels
with the Brother PT-D600

### Planting Calendar
This will be a calendar of plant/transplate/harvest dates for a given plant given a planting date.
The user will be able to add new plant data (time to germiniation, time to harvest)
as well as recurring events (multiple lettuce crops).
